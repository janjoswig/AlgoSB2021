# Algorithms in structural bioinformatics
## Machine learning methods to analyze and predict protein structure, dynamics and function

### Exercise material for the practical afternoon session on Monday, 8th of November 2021

The content of this exercise aligns with the morning lecture "Learning models of complex dynamics from simulation data" held by Bettina Keller.

### Requirements Installation Guidelines

The exercise will make use of Python Jupyter Notebooks and requires some python packages for data manipulation. We recommend to use a virtual environment for the requirements installation, e.g. with conda:

`conda create --name AlgoSB python=3.8 -y`

then activate your virtual environment

`conda activate AlgoSB`.

Inside your virtual environment run

`pip install -r requirements.txt`.

#### YAML File

You can also create a virtual environment with all the requirements installed with the `.yml`file we provide. Type

`conda env create -f env.yml`.
